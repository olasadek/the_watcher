## ü§ñ Multi-Agent System Architecture

### Agent Classification: **Static, Leaderless Multi-Agent System with Dynamic Intelligence**

### üèóÔ∏è Agent Types & Roles

#### Static Agents (Fixed Position)
- **Camera Agents**: Computer vision analysis at fixed campus locations
- **Security Booth Agents**: Personnel coordination at fixed security stations
- **GPS Location Agents**: Coordinate-based context providers for each fixed location

#### Dynamic Intelligence Layer
- **Dynamic Context Agent**: Central intelligence that processes location, cultural, and temporal context
- **Vision Analysis Agent**: Adaptive threshold management based on context agent input
- **Cultural Context Agent**: Provides religious and cultural awareness for threshold adaptation

### üîÑ Agent Communication Patterns

#### GPS ‚Üí Crowd Analysis Communication Flow
1. **GPS Agent** detects location context (country, population density, cultural factors)
2. **Dynamic Context Agent** processes location data and determines cultural adaptations
3. **Vision Analysis Agent** receives updated thresholds based on location context
4. **Camera Agents** apply country-specific thresholds for crowd monitoring

#### Event-Based Communication
1. **Cultural/Religious Events** trigger context updates
2. **Dynamic Context Agent** identifies affected countries and cameras
3. **Camera Agents** in target countries receive adjusted thresholds
4. **Security Booth Agents** receive notifications about threshold changes

### üåê Multi-National Operation

- **Targeted Event Application**: Events only affect cameras in specified countries
- **Cultural Intelligence**: Automatic adaptation to local cultural norms
- **Religious Awareness**: Prayer time recognition for multiple faiths simultaneously

### üéØ Leaderless Coordination
- **No Central Authority**: Each agent operates independently with shared context
- **Distributed Decision Making**: Agents make decisions based on shared context data
- **Fault Tolerance**: System continues operating if individual agents fail
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easy addition of new camera or security booth agents

### üß† Context-Aware Intelligence
- **Population Density Factors**: Higher tolerance in densely populated areas (Japan) vs sparse regions (Canada)
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Collectivist societies (Middle East, Asia) get higher crowd tolerance
- **Religious Scheduling**: Automatic prayer time recognition across all major world religions
- **Emergency Response**: Dynamic event creation for political situations or emergencies
